Welcome to the Movie Finder!!!

To start this application do the following: 
1. Clone this repository
2. While in repository, type "npm install" in the terminal
3. type in terminal: "node webservice.server.js" to start localhost version of the application

Breakdown of the assignment:
This was a really fun and challenging assignment. I felt comfortable with the requirements of the application and feel like I could have delivered on all of them with a bit more time. I definitely struggled to find the fastest and most efficient way to do things, but feel that the final product reflects a good basic idea of what was expected.

What I think I did well:
1. I was able to get the API working and returing the required info.
2. All of the required requests were handled properly by my backend.
3. Made good use of Node and Express to handle backend requests
4. Was able to produce a minimum viable product within the time frame.

What I would change/improve:
1. Obviously, the biggest issue was that I didn't use Vue for the front end. While I have used Vue in the past, I didn't feel that I would be able to produce a viable product using Vue in the alloted time. I tried to implement it at the end, but didn't have enough time to get it to work, so I scrapped that idea.
2. The styling is greatly lacking. I spent the majority of my time on the backend and didn't leave myself enough time to get the frontend styled adequately.
3. I had some issues with the file system and had to use some hacky code to get the proper paths to be served correctly when called. With more time I would organize that much better.
4. I was unable to add any unit tests. To be honest, I am not sure exactly what that is, or how to implement it.
5. As a bonus, I would like to add additional functionality to this app, like being able to save your favorite movies, or click on a movie and see more info about it.

Summary:
I thoroughly enjoyed my time working on this project. I hope that I was able to showcase my skills and basic understanding, while showing that I have the potential to grow and learn a lot more. I have a passion for this kind of work and I strive every day to learn more and better my skills. I truly hope that you will consider me for this position.
